Hi, I am Sumit, a senior year undergraduate student in the [CSD](https://www.iiit.ac.in/curriculum-csd/) programme at [IIIT-Hyderabad](https://iiit.ac.in/). I am advised by [Dr. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru](https://www.iiit.ac.in/faculty/ponnurangam-kumaraguru/) in the [Precog research group](https://precog.iiit.ac.in/). My primary research interest is Machine Learning on graphs, especially Knowledge Graphs and Graph Foundation Models.

I am also deeply passionate about football (soccer) and proudly represent my college as part of the IIIT-H football team. Apart from that, I have been doing [Competitve Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming) since middle school. Both these sports have been and continue to be a significant part of my life :)

Feel free to reach out to me through my [email](mailto:sumitkk01010@gmail.com) if youâ€™re interested in any of these areas and would like to have a chat!
